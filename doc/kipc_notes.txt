KIPC requirements:
1) Fastes way to pass information:
	- From user space to kernel space and back (the message is not passed
	  further i.e. only user<->kernel).
	- From user space to user space via kernel space (kernel pass the message
	  to other server/driver  i.e. user<->kernel<->user). The messageshould
	  not leave the kernel space and it passed only in between procs' kernel
	  structures. It's _not_ neccessary to copy the message it into the
	  user-space.
	- Architecture specific. On the x86 the registers should be used
	  (like system call macro see arch/x86/include/syscalls.h).
2) Clear/generic interface
	- each architecture will define its own low-layer interface and connects to
	  to the generic framework.
